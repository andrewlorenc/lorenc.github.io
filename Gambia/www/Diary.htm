<p>DIARY:</i></b></font></p>

<p>The main purpose of our trip was to visit Julia and Jan Sander
who are both working as volunteers in the Gambia for two years.
Staying in a family and being able to meet villagers in the bush
gave us a real insight into African life which went far beyond
our expectations. </p>

<p>After a 6 hour 30 flight which took us over Spain, Gibraltar
and the golden sands of the Sahara desert, we approached Banjul
by flying over the Sin&eacute;-Saloum delta in Senegal which we were to
explore later on, and landed amidst very arid countryside in
great need of a few drops of rain. But the rainy season will only
start in September. We were greeted by a disgustingly sun-tanned
Julia and her private taxi-driver Moussa without whom we would
have been assailed by numerous porters and drivers, all eager to
earn a few Dalasis. The taxi drive, whilst fairly confortable by
Gambian standards, already gave us a glimpse of memorable taxi
journeys which we were to experience throughout our stay. Very
friendly and chatty taxi-drivers made up for doors rattling,
windows without handles, leather seats in tatters, loose
dashboards not to mention the gigantic pot-holes in the tarmac
which forced them to use the sandy tracks on each side of the
road! We were in for an exciting adventure.</p>

<p>Three burnt out cars, totally covered in sand, provided us
with an excellent landmark to spot Julia's road. No name, no
tarmac, just a dusty sandy &quot;street&quot;, the third after
the Chinese Embassy!</p>

<p>Julia and Jan's house is in South Kanefing (near Serekunda on
the <a href="info.htm">map</a>) is part of a compound of two
houses well hidden behind a high wall with spikes on top to deter
intruders. The accommodation which was very spacious but basic by
European standards had been tastefully enhanced with numerous
batiks, attractive cane furniture and interesting decorations
such as Karabach containers, exotic shells or the head of a
dolphin found on Gunjur beach and nicknamed Oscar. </p>

<p>We set out immediately to the local beach and ended up at
Leybato for a Jul brew and bitter lemon. Restaurants rarely sell
fresh fruit juices, which is amazing, considering the amount of
fruits which are available. Our meal that evening which consisted
of locally caught ladyfish with spicy ratatouille, followed by
juicy paw-paw salad was most welcoming. </p>

<p>Sleeping soundly in the tropics turned out to be difficult to
achieve. After successfully spraying the mosquito net with the
magical Bop, we had high hopes. But dogs whining next door all
night long, morning call from the local cock along with the
painfully unattractive call to pray from the Oman from 5:00 to
5:30 forced us to take things easy the next day and never to rush
anywhere. The intense heat during the day - 35 to 40 degrees
sometimes - somewhat slowed our pace anyway! </p>

<p><u>Wednesday 28 </u></p>

<p>Julia had kindly taken a day off work (her task is to set up a
curriculum for primary schools, a challenge in itself considering
the obstacles she encounters such as inefficiency and
unreliability of the Gambian administrative staff), which she
used to drive us in her 4 wheel drive to the Bijilo Nature
Reserve Park. There we were treated with the sight of a dozen
green vervet monkeys who gently came to eat peanuts from our
hands. We were also very lucky to catch a glimpse of the shy and
elusive Red Colobus monkey jumping from tree to tree. We spotted
a myriad of birds, notably the Bee-eater with its rusty breast,
giant hornbills and waders on the beach.</p>

<p>Lunch was spent at the plush Kairaba Hotel where we had
scrumptious shrimps kebabs with garlic sauce, and where we
observed the local Coucal birds.</p>

<p>Some shopping was also done that day, with the purchase of an
African trousers outfit I was to wear extensively over the next 2
weeks.</p>

<p>We discussed work over dinner in a local restaurant (Yassa and
Damala chicken were on the menu). Jan was complaining about
corruption and inefficiency of the staff. Trivial issues seem to
be discussed during apparently important meetings, such as the
ordering of light bulbs for the offices. Jan shares an office
with women who appear to be incompetent. When we visited him in
his office later on, one of the girls was asleep on her desk!
Julia, on the other hand, is not allowed to do any photocopying
in view of her high position, but the delays which occur as a
result make her task extremely frustrating. It is somewhat
disheartening to see that recommendations made a few years ago by
previous volunteers have been totally ignored. Children have no
desks to work on, and the teaching methods are archaic. Children
are very passive, there is no group working, lessons are
repetitive, and children can be left without any work to do
sometimes for an hour with their heads down, while the teacher is
busy talking to another colleague. Julia is actively involved in
remedying these flaws but as things are done so slowly, she is
now wondering if anything will be achieved before she goes back
to England! She has also undertaken to learn the Wolof language
in order to communicate with her Gambian colleagues. We were
amazed at her progress in a few months, and her linguistic
ability has certainly allowed us to travel very cheaply by taxis.</p>

<p><u>Thursday 29</u></p>

<p>On our own this time to negotiate a taxi fare to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuko_Nature_Reserve">Abuko
Nature Reserve</a>, where the walk round the lake was a delight
with sightings of various kingfishers and herons. We then had a
drink at Lamin Lodge built on stilts and commanding lovely views
over the estuary. This area is famous for oysters which grow on
the mangroves in the creek. </p>

<p>The evening was spent on the roof of an expat's house
mastering the basic steps of African dancing. Basic but also
energetic and not ideal for blisters... My feet suffered for more
than 2 weeks as a result!</p>

<p>We had our first power cut, but the Sander's are well equipped
with a battery light which lasts for an hour. Hardly a day goes
by without a power cut. So frustrating when you are trying to
write reports on the computer!</p>

<p><u>Friday 30</u></p>

<p>We went to Banjul by bush van, which cost us the grand sum of
4 Dalasis! The procedure is very simple. Just stick up two
fingers in the air, and the bush van will stop if it is not full.
Then until it fills up to about 15 people, the apprentice will
shout out the destination to call for customers. </p>

<p>Visiting the Albert Market was an experience which we are not
likely to forget. Our Tourist status allowed a group of touts to
assail us to take us round the market. We then seemed to get out
of this situation by following another man who took us under his
protection. So with no more hassle, we were able to view the
colourful fruit stalls and walk through the meat and fish market,
as well as admiring the different batiks. At the end of our tour
we agreed to treat our guide to a drink, and after winding our
ways though backstreet alleys, we found ourselves in a so-called
caf&eacute; in a yard hidden behind a high wall. We started to feel
suspicious and the overcharged bill confirmed our fears. We had
been conned. When Andrew refused to pay the full amount (200
Dalasis for 3 drinks i.e. £10), the atmosphere started to heat
up and we had a job to get out of this place in one piece. This
was an unfortunate incident which was not to be repeated as we
learnt quickly how to turn down offers right from the start. </p>

<p>Before meeting Julia we visited the National museum devoted to
African culture. I was particularly interested to learn about
Fanels, type of lanterns in the shape of ships manufactured
around Christmas time. </p>

<p>After lunch with Julia and Jan (offices shut in the afternoon
to allow Muslims to pray) at the Heritage Caf&eacute; overlooking a
busy street, we bought peeled oranges in the market, and watched
admiringly Julia successfully haggling the price of fruit and
vegetables in Wolof!</p>

<p>On our way home we stopped at Leybato Beach (deformation of le
bateau) and made friends with the lady selling fresh fruits
juices. Paw-paw juice was a treat at 15 Dalasis only!</p>

<p><u>Saturday 30</u></p>

<p>Left home early in the morning to catch the first ferry from
Banjul to Barra on the north side of the river Gambia. All
passengers were loaded, ladies were balancing baskets and
containers on their heads very skilfully as well as carrying
babies on their backs, and men were carrying wood, tyres etc.
After much deliberation, Julia secured us a taxi to take us to
the Senegalese border, but it broke down before we got there. So
more haggling to secure a second taxi was required! Julia was not
only competent but seemed to enjoy the challenge. And what an
entertaining spectacle it was for us! Our second taxi took us to
the second border where yet more vociferous haggling took place
for another taxi to take us across the bush to Bandiala Gîte
near the Siné-Saloum Delta (These rivers are visible on the <a
href="info.htm">map</a> just north of the Gambia). The situation
was idyllic, our mud-brick and whitewashed houses set in the
middle of the Fethana forest. Meals were served undercover but
outside, allowing us to observe the red-jacketed Patas monkeys
coming to drink at the water point. Much of the afternoon was
spent in the hide watching the animals and birds feeding.
Apéritifs were consumed while eating barbecued oysters, a
speciality of the area. No after effects, they were delicious!
Even the dog was partial to them. The evening meal allowed to get
more acquainted with the French owner, who, with his wife, was of
French origin but third generation ex-pat, with dual
French-Senegalese nationality. </p>

<p><u>Sunday 1</u></p>

<p>The Siné-Saloum Delta being famous for its birdlife and its
deserted sandy beaches, we decided to spend the entire day there.
Our guide drove us in a jeep to the little fishing harbour of
Missarah where we boarded a pirogue which took us at a leisurely
pace through the mangrove swamps. At low tide in the morning we
were able to discover thousands of oysters clinging on to the
palétuviers and spotting numerous birds like the majestic
Goliath heron, pelicans and of course kingfishers. The mouth of
the delta provided a change of scenery and a blazing sun. We
headed for a deserted beach with glorious golden sand favoured by
a multitude of crabs, and had our picnic under a rustic shelter.
The salads and chicken prepared for us were most appreciated. We
then went to visit a village on the island conspicuous by its
lack of life. The Marabout was ill in bed, so we were allowed to
meander on our own, discover the well and admire the many
cashew-nut trees which represent a good source of income for the
villagers. Each fruit only produces one nut, which would explain
why cashews are expensive back in England. The afternoon was
spent swimming and reading. Despite my spell of dehydration, this
beach will remain paradise on earth for us. </p>

<p>Back at the lodge we had a game of boules with some skilful
players from Dakar, watched by an unwelcome black scorpion which
ended up in an vivarium that evening. Raw fish soaked in vinegar
as an appetiser, followed by shrimps fritters and a delectable
fish soufflé and crème caramel, ensured a most enjoyable
evening.</p>

<p><u>Monday 2</u></p>

<p>Up at the crack of dawn we followed Chris on a very
informative bird walk in the bush. The dawn chorus was impressive
and Chris was able to point out to us many local birds and inform
us on their habitat. We caught a glimpse of a wart-hog and
examined the tree whose rough bark was worn smooth by his
rubbing. Next time I go to Africa though, I will purchase a bird
guidebook with names in English and in French!</p>

<p>As the taxi which was due to pick us up at 10:00 a.m. had
failed to turn up (not unusual in this part of the world) we set
out to walk under a blazing sun to Missarah hoping to find a
means of transport. We accepted a lift in a very old Peugeot,
which, after many bouts of coughing, broke down in the middle of
the bush. Out we came, refusing to pay the driver and his friend,
and off we went again in search of the main road! We were making
a habit of this. Water supply was running low, so we were
relieved to find a lift after half an hour's walking and an hour
waiting under the shade of a baobab tree. The situation turned
out hilarious as we stopped to pick up the drivers of the broken
down taxi some miles away. Smiles were exchanged but no money was
offered! In Tubakuta Julia competently secured us a taxi to take
us back to the border. Our troubles however did not end there as
I was told then that my visa was not valid. Julia saved the day
again (she was ready to bribe the official with money!) and we
made our way to Barra. </p>

<p>We inquired about boarding a pirogue, and having followed some
touts to the boarding beach, we decided that the overloaded
embarkation was a little precarious for the rough sea, and headed
back to the village. A cunningly disguised caf&eacute; behind net
curtains and corrugated iron made our wait for the next ferry
more bearable. However a trip to the local loos by the sea
definitely widened our Gambian experience! </p>

<p>Usual rush of women, men and donkeys to catch the ferry at 4
p.m. As soon as we left we realised that this was not to be an
ordinary crossing. <font size="2"><i>(I disagree - I suspect it
was usual! Andrew).</i></font> One of the few lorries on board
was so heavily loaded that it started swaying from left to right
prompting Julia to shout orders to unload it from the top deck,
but to no avail. I must admit that I started locating the safety
buoys! Back onto safe land, Julia confessed that she had been
scared too. Not a very nice experience, but we survived to tell
the tale. The taxi ride home could have been uneventful, had it
not been for my door which refused to close. Fortunately Andrew
held on tight to the handle of the window all through the journey
to prevent his wife from hitting the potholes! This was truly a
wonderful trip full of the unexpected. The evening was most
pleasantly spent at Francisco restaurant amongst lush tropical
vegetation - a favourite with Toubabs.</p>

<p><u>Tuesday 3</u></p>

<p>While Jan and Julia were at work, we caught up with our
hand-washing, and ventured on our own to Bakau where we
immediately befriended a Senegalese eager to earn a few Dalasis
in return of a guided tour of the town. We first paid a visit to
the sacred crocodile pool at Kachically located in the heart of
Bakau's native compounds and we were encouraged to touch the
beasts as they sunned themselves on the banks. The waters of the
pool are supposed to have powers of fertility for women. They
must be very desperate! After a long walk through the market, we
ended up at the fishing harbour unfortunately reeking of smoked
fish and sewers. We parted company with our guide and enjoyed
resting our feet in a hammock facing the sea for the rest of the
day.</p>

<p><u>Wednesday 4</u></p>

<p>This was the start of a 2-day trip inland following the Gambia
River as far as the colonial town of Janjanbureh (Georgetown on
the <a href="info.htm">map</a>). This gave us an excellent
insight into rural life. I found the African villages most
attractive with their circular huts with thatched roofs peeping
over high fences of neatly trimmed tree branches (doubly used as
washing lines), and its centrally placed well surrounded by a
concrete ledge, a favourite meeting place for children women and
animals. Women pounding millet by the side of the road and groups
of men sitting under trees were a familiar sight. The road to
Janjanbureh was however very long and in a dreadful condition
most of the way. The landscape was totally different from Senegal
with its rice paddies with women working in them and its more
fertile land. I enjoyed stopping at Bureng market admiring women
in their lovely colourful outfits selling peanuts and oranges
from a wheelbarrow, young children driving donkey carts, men
praying in front of the mosque, little children singing under a
hut for our benefit, all this with a tumultuous and noisy
background. </p>

<p>Back on the road, we were astounded to see a group of baboons
crossing the battered tarmac, and a goat having a rough ride on
top of a crowded bush van! We then reached the <a
href="https://www.accessgambia.com/hotelweb/m-bird-safari-camp.html">Bird Safari Camp</a> owned by an
English civil servant, via a ferry. As usual we were asked to
sponsor children who make a habit of brandishing a piece of paper
with their name and address on. One has to be firm otherwise one
could be pestered non-stop. The camp which was built using local
material in the African style, was basically furnished, had no
electricity and was complete with permanent residents such as
mice and lizards in some huts, and 3 monitor lizards near the
rubbish heap. Not enough to deter us from enjoying ourselves!</p>

<p>After a welcomed dip in the pool (the heat was intense), we
agreed to go and see Wassu's stone circles as all good tourists
do. Quite impressive, but I must admit that the walk through the
local forest was more rewarding for me and allowed us to spot a
bearded barbet, red-throat bee-eaters, a yellow-crowned gonolek
and a scarlet-chested sunbird. That was thrilling. </p>

<p>After the buffet meal, some local villagers provided
entertainment by dancing and playing the gembay. Unfortunately
their singing skills left to be desired. We retired to bed early
having been bitten by our first mosquitoes.</p>

<p><u>Thursday 5</u></p>

<p>An amazing bird chorus woke us up gently at dawn, and after
visiting the very sleepy and uninteresting town of Janjanbureh
(formerly known as Georgetown) and its slave house, we were taken
by Steve, our very jovial host for a boat ride on the Gambia
river. Our knowledgeable guide was a well of information
regarding bird life. The highlight of the trip however was to
spot the elusive Colobus monkeys swinging from trees to trees
with apparently no effort, and the hippopotamus who made an
appearance in the distance for us. A scrumptious lunch was
swiftly served by two African staff. What a lovely setting! </p>

<p>On our journey back, we encountered black pigs and of course
goats crossing the roads and remarked on the impatience of our
driver who seemed to blow his horn constantly. Part of our trip
included a visit to a village situated by the side of the road.
We were ushered into one bedroom littered with clothes, plastic
bowls and metal containers and leading onto a yard where a young
girl was making fritters under intense heat. We paused a few
minutes in the bedroom watching a young woman feeding her one
month old baby. She was one of the four wives of the head of the
family. All these people apparently live happily together in the
same compound despite the obvious poverty. A collection made by
our party was gracefully accepted and a few pictures were allowed
to be taken. </p>

<p>On our way back we passed The Gambia College in Brikama, where
Julia lectures teachers. We felt very sorry for her for having to
drive there everyday and tolerating the potholes and the amazing
dust. I believe that she is hoping to move to an office in
Banjul. In the meantime however, the suspension of her 4
wheel-drive has been permanently damaged.</p>

<p><u>Friday 6</u></p>

<p>A very low-key day spent writing postcards and shopping for
Batiks at Agee and lazing in the hammock. Met Julia's daughter
Helen and her daughter Alice who arrived from England that
afternoon. We spent the evening eating round the pool of the
Safari Gardens, again a favourite haunt for Toobabs.</p>

<p><u>Saturday 7</u></p>

<p>Julia, Jan, Andrew and myself headed for Gunjur, 30 kms south
from Banjul, stopping on the way in Kunkujang, a little village
lost in the bush where VSO volunteers are actively involved in
funding the building of a nursery school and also setting up a
bee-keeping project. This was truly a humbling experience for us
as we were treated like royalty by the villagers. Balla welcomed
us in his modest home and a great number of men came to shake
hands with us. Two of them peeled oranges for us before we set
out to meet the children who were having their lessons under a
Kola tree. Each in their turn, they were reciting the alphabet
and counting for the whole class to repeat after them. It was
very refreshing to see all those smiley little faces who were
obviously on their best behaviour. We were then shown the way to
the bee-hives past the farms and via a long dusty track through
fields which would be yielding vital crops of vegetables in the
rainy season. A little rest under a baobab tree with more oranges
offered as a refresher, and then one of the men took great pride
in showing us the 8 hives hidden under trees well away from the
children. A photo-album was then produced to testify the total
commitment to this project. With more money, they could erect a
fence all around the area.</p>

<p>Our next call was to check on the progress of the nursery
school building. Our arrival was hailed by the sound of children
shouting &quot;welcome, welcome&quot; and clapping their hands.
Mums and Dads were gathered there too, begging us to take
pictures with their babies who were so cute! It was quite a
moving experience for us all. The school now has a roof. The
whole village had a major part in erecting the school, whether it
was mixing the cement with spades or fetching the water, all this
in the heat of the day. The thousand pounds granted to them by
VSO have been wisely used. Now they need more funds to make some
furniture and provide some basic school equipment. Individual
slates would be lovely. I am now very anxious to know how much
money my school in England has raised for that purpose. We were
certainly very grateful to Julia and Jan to take us to Kunkujang
and see for ourselves what a good job they all had done. It was
such a worthwhile and rewarding experience. I could not help
being overwhelmed by the love emanating from these children, At
one stage, we all had four children holding hands with us. We had
to part however, in order to return to Balla's house where Julia
and Jan's task was to check the accounts of the projects. Balla
explained for example how he was planning to use profits made
from selling honey advisedly. Jan was most impressed by their
excellent organisation and commitment.</p>

<p>After the business was carried out, we were all ushered into a
smaller but cooler room at the back, where we witnessed the
tea-making ceremony, (but I wonder why we never drank it!) and
where we ate a passa, a fish stew cooked by Balla's wife, from
the communal bowl placed on the floor. A new experience for
Andrew and me! They actually provided spoons for us to eat. We
drank water from a communal jug.</p>

<p>Before we left, we gave them an assortment of pens and
notebooks, and we were showered with presents too, but more of
the consumable sort, like paw-paws, oranges, mangoes and their
own produced honey. As expected more photos were taken to
remember this happy occasion!</p>

<p>When we arrived in Gunjur an hour later, the fishing harbour
was a hype of activity with pirogues coming back ashore, and
women and children rushing to bring back the catch of the day in
colourful plastic containers, balanced on their heads. Hearing
the men struggling to heave the pirogues onto rollers on the
beach was very entertaining. We passed dozens of
brightly-coloured pirogues, fishermen's huts and a
&quot;grazing&quot; cow on our way to our Gunjur Beach Hotel
advertised by a very dilapidated sign. The roar made by the waves
was astounding and augured well for fun bathing. The hotel owned
by an eccentric Swiss-German couple was very welcoming. Rooms
also had permanent residents as testified by the mice droppings
but we slept like logs that night, after a walk to the other side
of the beach to hear gembay being played in another hotel.</p>

<p><u>Sunday 8</u></p>

<p>Walking along <a
href="https://www.accessgambia.com/information/gunjur.html">the deserted beach</a>
in search of exotic shells was very romantic and reinvigorating.
I also took great pleasure watching the vultures scavenging for
dead fish on the beach, and the weaver-birds in the hotel
gardens. </p>

<p>Julia and Jan returned that afternoon to Banjul, while we
stayed enjoying the bathing, the sand and the musical background
provided by corra, guitar and gembay playing on the beach. Andrew
also kept to his promise to have a midnight swim!</p>

<p><u>Monday 9</u></p>

<p>After an early swim, we set out to catch a bush van to
Serekunda to take us home. Abraham saw an opportunity to earn a
few Dalasis by giving us an informative tour of the fishing
village and the smokehouses, which was most interesting. For the
princely sum of eight Dalasis each (80p), we shared a bush van
packed with 16 passengers, a hen and boxes of smoked fish. The
dust was so thick that we all had to protect our faces with any
cloth at hand. A few stops on the way to check the ailing engine
made this journey one that I would not willingly repeat.</p>

<p>Our last evening in Kanifing was spent bird watching along the
golf course, chatting to a palm-wine tapper, and eating leisurely
at El Mondo restaurant by the sea.</p>

<p><u>Tuesday 10</u></p>

<p>Last minute photos taken in front of the compound, quick
packing and off we went to our favourite beach at Leybato before
our taxi collected us to go to the airport. I think it was the
hottest day we had so far. The road to the airport was also the
best one we had ever driven on in the Gambia!</p>

<p>We feel very privileged to have been able to visit both The
Gambia and The Senegal and are indebted to Jan and Julia for
sharing their experience with us.</p>
