        We found out something about the Gambia</a>. It is the
        smallest country in Africa, with few natural resources
        other than fish. An ex-British colony, English is the
        official language. By African standards it is politically
        stable, and safe. </td>

        The Gambia is surrounded by Senegal, an ex-French colony</a>.
        We originally planned to visit there too - its capital
        Dakar is the most important and lively city in West
        Africa. However, we learnt that transport between the
        countries is difficult, and Dakar is noisy and polluted.
        So we only went a short distance into Senegal, with Julia
        and Jan. </td>

<p><em>(links no longer working)</em>Of interest was the <a
href="http://www.alm-it.freeserve.co.uk/travelog/index.htm">travelog
of people who drove round Africa</a>, through <a
href="http://www.alm-it.freeserve.co.uk/country/senegal/index.htm">Senegal</a>
to the <a
href="http://www.alm-it.freeserve.co.uk/country/gambia/index.htm">Gambia</a>.
Our experiences confirmed their impressions, and we were quite
happy not to drive!</p>

<p>We also found a <a
href="http://cgi.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/in_focus/travellers_tales/travellersafrica.shtml">report
of a couple doing VSO</a>, like Julia and Jan.</p>

<p>Most people book through <a href="http://www.gambia.co.uk/">the
Gambia Experience</a>, but we found the cheapest tickets (£299),
on the same Monarch charter flights, through <a
href="http://www.citybreak.co.uk/farebasesearches/charterindex.htm">Lupus
Travel</a>.</p>
